        <h2>Spicy Vegan Chili</h2>
        <p>Made this by tweaking a family recipe to make it vegan. </p>
        <p>Great on Cinco de Mayo or football Sunday!</p>
        <p>Cornbread is a great addition to this dish.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>1 large green bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 jalapeno peppers, chopped (Optional)</li>
            <li>¼ cup chili powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
            <li>1 cup rinsed, uncooked white rice</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can corn</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella-style vegan cheese (such as Daiya®)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute bell pepper, onion, and jalapeno peppers until tender, about 3 minutes. Add chili powder, salt, cumin, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, making sure chili powder does not burn.</li>
            <li>Stir tomatoes, beans, water, and rice into the pot. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Check every 10 to 15 minutes if extra water is needed; add 1/4 cup at a time.</li>
            <li>Stir corn and pepper into the chili and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. Serve with vegan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
